    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>      Hello everyone. My name is Maria Boianju. I am a student in <br>
       University of Bolton. I started with a course for junior iOS <br>
       developers two years ago.<br><br> I decided to expand my knowledge <br>
       after I had completed that course. And I chose the University <br> 
       of Bolton to do it. First year of studing was very interesting <br> 
       but it was not enough for me. <br><br>So I realised that I want to spend my spare <br>
       time compliting another online course. I chose the Switch career <br>
       company to help me succeed in the IT field.
